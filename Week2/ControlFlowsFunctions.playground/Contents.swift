//CONTROW FLOW

//Code Tips
//Use camelCase
//Don't need semi-colons (optional)
//cmd + forward slash = quickly comment out code
//DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself (don't copy and paste code -- put it in a function)

//Data Types

//Char
//includes emojis ðŸ˜€
"A"

//String
"this is a string"

//Int
-1
0
1

//Double/Float
12.3

//Bool
true
false

//Const: cannot change value
let myFavoriteNumber: Int = 100
//cannot do this:
//myFavoriteNumber = 200

//Var
var money: Int = 100
money = 200

//Type Inference: assume data type
//Click "option" and click on var name to affirm the data type
let name = "Connie"

//Assume a decimal number is a Double
let b = 24.5

//Double takes twice as much space as a float
//more space means more precision

//If want to be a Float, need to explicitly type Float
let a: Float = 24.5

//Injecting something into a sentence
let computer = "Macbook"

//Concatenate
let sentence = "My favorite computer is a..."
    + computer

//String Interpolation
let sentence1 = "My favorite computer is a \(computer)"
//the interpolation doesn't have to be a variable; can be any data type

//Operators & Operands
//Operators: +, -, *, /
//Operand: the numbers being manipulated
//expression: operators & operand

14/5
//14/2 = 2


14/5.0
//14/5.0 - 2.8

//mod operator
//helps with fidning odd/even

//String interpolation

//Control Flow
//Boolean Values & Operators
//Every boolean expresion needs to be true for entire expression to be ture
true
false

//Boolean Expression
1 > 5
//false

//Logical Operations: combined with boolean expresions
// AND &&: both must e ture
// OR ||: only one has to be true
// NOT !
!true
!false

myFavoriteNumber > 5 && myFavoriteNumber < 10

//Branching

//switch case needs to exhaustive: compared to every single value in the data type
